Product Localization Translation Memory
=======================================

A translation memory (TM) is a repository or database that contains translated source and target language pairs. It reduces translation time and cost by reusing translated content from the repository in computer-aided translation (CAT) tools where human translators can see full or partial matches for sentences in the translation editor.
