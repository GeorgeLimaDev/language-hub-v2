VTEX Localization Style Guide for English

VTEX Localization Style Guide for English
=========================================

Created by: Clara Cruz

Updated by: Clara Cruz

Last updated: August 17, 2023

Introduction
------------

*   Adapt punctuation and capitalization to the target language.
*   It’s OK to split or combine sentences when it improves readability.
*   Consider the intent of the text to convey the message, even if you take the liberty to slightly modify the structure of the sentence. If needed, rewrite as if you were writing the content yourself.

### Product Localization

Product

*   UI strings (github, Figma)

Product Marketing

*   Pop-ups in the UI

Education

*   Product documentation and announcements

Legal

*   Agreements, terms and conditions, privacy policies

British vs. American English
----------------------------

The standard for content is English - US.

For example, words that might include either the letter o or the letters ou are written with o (e.g. color, not colour; humor, not humour) and words ending in ze or se should be written with ze (e.g. materialize, not materialise; apologize, not apologise).

Some Marketing Enablement content is adapted for English - UK.

For more information, see [VTEX Content Styleguide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gURayqRV2-Cb23_7Z1Isph3KvbVKwl3WvAZe7YX2A34/edit#heading=h.7rfcjkvjmem6).

Gender-neutral language
-----------------------

You can use the singular they as a generic third-person singular pronoun to refer to a person whose gender is unknown or irrelevant to the context.

When “they” is the subject of a sentence, “they” takes a plural verb regardless of whether “they” is meant to be singular or plural. For example, write “they are,” not “they is.” The singular “they” works similarly to the singular “you”—even though “you” may refer to one person or multiple people, in a scholarly paper you should write “you are,” not “you is.” However, if the noun in one sentence is a word like “individual” or a person’s name, use a singular verb.

Capitalization
--------------

### Words, concepts, teams and roles

As per the [VTEX Content Styleguide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gURayqRV2-Cb23_7Z1Isph3KvbVKwl3WvAZe7YX2A34/edit#heading=h.7rfcjkvjmem6):

The name of the company is in all caps: VTEX.

Some of our commonly-used words include: marketplace, omnichannel, headless, microservices. Do not capitalize these unless they’re at the beginning of a sentence!

Only use capitalization of words when they imply a concept, rather than something tangible. Some of the concepts we regularly use, coupled with their associated meaning, are:

*   Collaborative Commerce = Teaming up with customers, suppliers, channel partners and even competitors to deliver more value to your customers;
*   Headless Fatigue = Slow-paced evolution and loss of focus due to developer dependency and infrastructure maintenance after companies choose to build more than they can handle using headless technology;
*   Composable Commerce = The modern approach by which a business is empowered to select and assemble various commerce solutions and use them to satisfy specific commercial requirements;
*   Unified Commerce = Combines in one platform ecommerce, m-commerce, order fulfillment, inventory management, customer relationship management, Point of Sale (POS) capabilities — and much more.

You also need to capitalize teams and roles.

Example: Bernardo Lemgruber, Content Marketing Leader, is working within the Marketing Enablement team.

### Document titles and headings

As per the [VTEX Content Styleguide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gURayqRV2-Cb23_7Z1Isph3KvbVKwl3WvAZe7YX2A34/edit#heading=h.7rfcjkvjmem6):

Use sentence case. This means only the first word of the title/heading is capitalized (besides other special words that should be capitalized following their own rules – see above section for details).

Example:

✔️ The commerce platform with the fastest growth rate is VTEX, according to IDC

✘ The Commerce Platform With the Fastest Growth Rate Is VTEX, According to IDC

Never write a title or a heading in all caps (or any part of a text, for that matter), because IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION YOU ARE SHOUTING TO THE READER.

Do not use a full stop ( . ) in titles or headings.

If you want to use a colon ( : ) in your title, treat the two parts of your title as one sentence each, meaning both parts will be capitalized using a sentence case.

Example:

✔️ Composable Commerce: The new era of digital transformation

### UI and technical texts

Always use title case for: Titles, Buttons.

Use sentence case for: Descriptions, Empty States, Labels, Controls (toggles, checkboxes, radio buttons), Text Input, Transitional Text, Confirmation Messages, Alerts, Errors.

For more information, see the [VTEX UX Writing Guidelines](https://uxwriting.vtex.com/docs/text-patterns/titles).

Punctuation
-----------

### Quotation marks

Place closing quotation marks:

*   Outside commas and periods. This applies even when quoting UI elements.
*   Example: Select “Users.”
*   Inside other punctuation.

Exception: If punctuation is part of the quoted material, place it inside the quotation marks.

### Commas

#### Oxford comma

*   In Product Localization (Education and UI), use the oxford (serial) comma.
*   The [VTEX Content Styleguide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gURayqRV2-Cb23_7Z1Isph3KvbVKwl3WvAZe7YX2A34/edit#heading=h.7rfcjkvjmem6) created by the Marketing Content Team advises against it.

#### Other cases

Do not use a comma before “because” as when PT uses a comma before “pois”.

Example:

Se você deseja que as mesmas configurações sejam aplicadas em seus canais de venda, não é necessário criar uma política comercial nova, pois uma mesma política comercial pode ser usada para diferentes canais de venda.

If you want the same settings to apply to your sales channels, you don’t need to create a new trade policy because the same trade policy can be used for different sales channels.

### Lists and semicolons

When there is a list of items, it is better to use a period for each item rather than a colon as is common in source texts.

### Dash and hyphen

A hyphen (-) is a punctuation mark that is used to join words or parts of words only. To type a hyphen, press the hyphen (minus) key on the keyboard.

An em dash (—) is a punctuation mark that can be used to replace parentheses or a colon to create emphasis in your writing. To type an em dash, press \[Alt+0+1+5+1\]. Use spaces both before and after an em dash.

An en dash (–) is a punctuation mark that is used to indicate intervals of time or ranges of numbers. To type an en dash, press \[Alt+0+1+5+0\]. Do not use spaces neither before nor after an en dash.

Grammar
-------

### Verb form in Education titles

For the list of sections at the beginning, try using the infinitive whenever possible. For the respective titles throughout the article, use the -ing form. This decision was based on Salesforce articles and other technical documentation.

### Articles

#### Indefinite article a/an with SKU

SKU can be pronounced as individual letters or as a syllable. This changes the form of the indefinite preposition that should precede it.

An “S”-“K”-“U”

A “SKU”

We assume the “SKU” pronunciation and use the preposition as “a.”

Pronunciation examples:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qppwXva8L\_Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qppwXva8L_Q)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-QnvKD-rE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-QnvKD-rE)

#### Use of article with proper nouns

Generally, no article is used before proper nouns in English.

Example: VTEX Intelligent Search is a feature that allows you to configure search terms.

Exceptions: In some cases, product names are treated as common nouns. Some exceptions are:

*   VTEX Admin
*   In the VTEX Admin, go to Sales Performance.
*   VTEX Help Center
*   You can contact our team, through the Help Center.

### Using noun as adjectives (singular)

In English, many menu names/page titles/product names take the form of a noun modifying a noun (as an adjective) + a noun. When a noun modifies another noun as an adjective in EN, the modifying noun is used in the singular (with some few exceptions.)

Some examples are

*   Order Management (-> management of orders, not Orders Management)
*   Price Rules (-> Rules of prices, not Prices Rules)

The main exceptions are nouns that are used in plural regardless of number, like "sports" (sports store) or "clothes" (clothes line).

### Prepositions

#### Prepositions and UI elements

Useful resources about prepositions and UI elements:

[The IBM Style Guide](https://books.google.com.br/books?id=V7NWEu_bLXsC&pg=PA214&lpg=PA214&dq=prepositions+used+with+interface+elements&source=bl&ots=N8tyfamrqo&sig=ACfU3U16PZ_62szxbRVvm28kQ9lPeWokQw&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=prepositions%20used%20with%20interface%20elements&f=false)

#### Ending a sentence with a preposition

It's OK to end a sentence with a preposition when it improves readability.

Examples:

Use a different instrumentation key for each environment that your application runs in.

Specify which event hub you want to send the data to.

References:

[Microsoft blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/writing/what-is-a-preposition#:~:text=Can%20I%20end%20a%20sentence,sound%20better%20when%20they%20do.)

[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/end-sentence-preposition/)

#### Log in to vs. Log into

Log in is a phrasal verb that means that you connect to a machine (such as a host, server, workstation and so on) or authenticate to a user interface by providing your credentials. In this case, to is a preposition that links the phrasal verb to the upcoming word.

That is why the correct spelling is log in to not log into.

Examples:

*   ✘ Log into the VAO UI as a VAO Administrator or Plan Author.
*   ✔️ Log in to the VAO UI as a VAO Administrator or Plan Author.
*   ✘ Log into the machine where Veeam ONE Monitor Client is installed.
*   ✔️ Log in to the machine where Veeam ONE Monitor Client is installed.

Reference: [Veeam Technical Writing Style Guide](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/styleguide/tw/log_in_to.html)

#### Click vs. Click on vs. Click at

Click is about pressing a mouse button to select a link or item on the screen. Use Click as a transitive verb that acts as an action verb and has a direct object — this means that no preposition is required after the verb.

Examples:

In the Parameter Details column, click the Edit button next to the Default Value field.

To save changes made to the parameter settings, click Save.

Reference: [https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/styleguide/tw/click.html](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/styleguide/tw/click.html)

#### On VTEX and at VTEX

When referring to VTEX as a platform or system, use on VTEX.

Example:

On VTEX, the Google Tag Manager integration is native, which simplifies setting up the tool for analyzing store browsing data.

Examples from other companies

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/apps/sap-production](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/apps/sap-production)

[https://access.redhat.com/articles/6093611](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6093611)

When referring to VTEX as a company, use at VTEX.

Examples:

Renata Lorenz is the Vice President of Product at VTEX.

At VTEX, we follow the most effective security practices.

Examples from other companies

[https://shopify.engineering/work-with-us](https://shopify.engineering/work-with-us)

#### In Checkout and at checkout

Use in Checkout when talking about the VTEX Checkout solution. Use at when referring to the checkout step/page of a purchase.

Examples:

This new feature will be available in Checkout after September.

The customer will see this payment method at checkout.

### Compound and hyphenated words

As the English language itself evolves, lots of word associations are becoming compound words. There are three ways to write these: open compound (spelled as two words, e.g. ice cream), closed compound (joined to form a single word, e.g. notebook) and hyphenated compound (words joined by a hyphen, e.g. long-term).

Here are some of the compounds we use regularly that should be written consistently throughout our content:

Closed compounds:

✔️ Ecommerce, email, ebook

✘ e-anything

✔️ Microservices

✘ Micro-services, micro services

✔️ Whitepaper

✘ white paper, white-paper

✔️ Dropship

✘ drop ship, drop-ship

✔️ Frontend

✘ front-end, front end

✔️ Backend

✘ back-end, back end

Hyphenated compounds:

✔️ Pick-up in-store

✘ pickup in store, pick-up in-store, pick up in store

✔️ Ship-from-home

✘ ship from home

✔️ Digital-first

✘ digital first

✔️ First-party, third-party

✘ first party, third party

Use a hyphen if two or more words are functioning as an adjective before a noun: fastest-growing platform; world-class retailer; user-friendly UX, etc.

Reference: [VTEX UX Writing Guidelines](https://uxwriting.vtex.com/docs/text-patterns/titles)

### Contractions

Contractions are generally accepted and used in VTEX content: UI, technical documentation, blog posts.

Some guidelines:

*   Use common contractions, such as it’s,you’re, that's, and don’t, to create a friendly, informal tone.
*   Don't mix contractions and their spelled-out equivalents in UI text. For example, don’t use can’t andcannot in the same UI.
*   Never form a contraction from a noun and a verb, such as Microsoft’s developing a lot of new cloud services.
*   Avoid ambiguous or awkward contractions, such as there’d, it’ll, and they’d.
*   Avoid using them in contracts and content with a very formal tone.

Numbers
-------

If a number is under 10, spell it out (e.g. one, two, three, etc.) If it is over (and including) 10, write it using digits (e.g. 43, 775).

*   Exception: You can refrain from spelling out numbers under 10 if they are present in the title, because having numbers in titles has been shown to increase the click-through rate.

Big numbers should have a comma ( , ) placed at every third digit from right to left to help the reader distinguish the magnitude of the number (e.g. 37,809,001). You can use large number abbreviations for informal pieces the following way:

*   60 thousand = 60K
*   60 million = 60M
*   60 billion = 60B
*   60 trillion = 60T

Avoid writing numbers at the beginning of the sentence, but if it’s a must, spell it out.

Example:

✔️ Half / Fifty percent of the shoppers have opted for pick-up in-store.

✘ 50% of shoppers have opted for pick-up in-store

Reference: [VTEX UX Writing Guidelines](https://uxwriting.vtex.com/docs/text-patterns/titles)

### Currency

When writing money figures, ensure you are localizing the style according to the currency (i.e. some currencies place the symbol before the amount, some after; some leave a space before the amount, some don’t, etc.). For symbols that are used for multiple currencies (e.g. $ for dollars in America, Canada, Australia, etc.), make sure to add the country code/currency name to distinguish the currency.

Example:

✔️ $20 USD

✔️ R$ 20

✔️ £20

✔️ €20

Reference: [VTEX UX Writing Guidelines](https://uxwriting.vtex.com/docs/text-patterns/titles)

### Dates

When referring to a specific date in the month-day date format, use cardinal numbers (one, two, three) rather than ordinal numbers (first, second, third). This may feel counterintuitive because we normally use ordinal numbers when we “speak” of dates. For example, one would say January first two thousand seventeen but write January 1, 2017.

Example: Daniel was born on May 13.

In the month-day-year format (used in the United States), place commas after the day and year.

Example: On May 13, 2007, Daniel was born.

When writing a long-form date, use a comma after days of the week to ensure readability.

Examples:

How fortunate that the world did not end on Friday, December 21, 2012!

Monday, May 5, is my last day of work.

Reference: [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/how-to-write-dates/)

### Time format

We should use lowercase a.m. and p.m., with periods. Do not forget to add a space between the time and the a.m. or p.m. If it's an exact hour, no “:00” is required.

Examples: 6 p.m. | 6:30 a.m. | 8 p.m.

When a time is giving in Brazil time, include the GMT format.

Example: 10:30 a.m São Paulo (GMT-3).

For more information about time zones, see this [article](https://editorsmanual.com/articles/time-zones/#daylight-saving).

Reference: [Western Michigan University Writing Style Guide](https://wmich.edu/writing/rules/times)

### Symbols

Use space between the number and the unit of measure.

Example: 5 MB

When the unit is a symbol and not an abbreviation (letters), no space is used.

Example: 36%, 5’

### Percent and percentage

The one-word spelling is standard in American English while the two-word per cent is preferred in other varieties of English.

In a range or series of percentages, repeat the per cent sign after each number:

*   40%–60% \[In a range, use the en dash between percentages.\]
*   discounts of 20%, 30% and 40%

If no figure is mentioned, use percentage, not per cent:

*   What percentage (not per cent) of your company’s employees work flexible hours?

Specific subjects
-----------------

### According to

According to has several definitons as shown below. But it’s most often used to credit a quote, fact, or other information as stated in the second definition.

1.  If you do something according to a plan, system, or set of rules, you do it in a way that agrees with or obeys that plan, system, or set of rules

*   Example:
*   We should try to play the game according to the rules
    .

3.  Go according to plan (=happen in the way that was intended or planned)

*   Example:
*   If everything goes according to plan, they should finish by Thursday.
    .

5.  Used for saying where information or ideas have come from

*   Examples:
*   According to newspaper reports, fighting has broken out in the northern provinces.
*   According to Freud, our dreams represent our hidden desires.

7.  Used for saying that something changes or is different depending on the situation

*   Examples:
*   Each child will be helped according to his or her needs.
*   The amount of tax people pay varies according to where they live.

Source: [Macmillan Dictionary](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/used)

Try to use based on or depending on as much as possible.

Examples:

*   The choice of which seller will deliver the items will be based on priority criteria.
*   In addition to the \*\*total amount\*\*, orders have an \*\*invoiced amount\*\*, which, for legal reasons, may not include the interest applied based on a payment method.
*   Weight-based additional shipping charge, calculated based on the total weight of the order, in decimal number.
*   Renders a customized banner based on the search query.

### Amount and value

The term valor in Portuguese has two possible translations into English. When speaking of money, especially in business transactions (checkout and invoices), the correct term is amount. On the other hand, when referring to other variables in the system, value should be used.

Examples:

1.  Pedido foi gerado com valor fora da Regra de divergência de valores configurada.

*   The order was generated with an amount different from the configured price divergence rule.

3.  Os possíveis valores são \`is\` ou \`contains\`.

*   The possible values are \`is\` or \`contains\`.

### Data (Singular usage)

Treat “data” as a singular noun.

Reference: [https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#letter-d](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#letter-d)

Usage Note: The word data is the plural of Latin datum, "something given." In English, most notably in scientific usage, this plural usage is still common, as in this example: "Eventually, his data suggest, a tumor's ... alterations give rise to mutant cells" (Janet Raloff). But data is also standard in denoting a singular mass entity (like information), especially in writing for a more general audience: "Before data is transmitted in bulk around the internet, it is routinely compressed to reduce redundancy" (Richard Dawkins). "Goodall ... wanted to get as much data as possible from her animals before she had to leave them" (Elizabeth Royte). In our 2005 survey, 66 percent of the Usage Panel accepted the use of data with a singular verb and pronoun in the sentence Once the data is in, we can begin to analyze it. Fully 92 percent accepted the sentence We have very little data on the efficacy of such programs, the same percentage that accepted the use of data as a plural noun. (Note that the quantifier very little, like much in the last quotation given above, is not used with plural nouns such as facts or results.) The percentages in the 2005 survey represent significant increases over those of our 1988 survey, making it safe to say that singular data has become a standard usage.

Reference: [https://www.thefreedictionary.com/data](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/data)

### Ecommerce

At the end of 2020, we adopted a company-wide practice of spelling ecommerce.

✔️ ecommerce

✘ e-commerce

✘ eCommerce

✘ e-Commerce

✘ Ecommerce\*

✘ Any other variant our creative minds might come up with

Reference: [VTEX UX Writing Guidelines](https://uxwriting.vtex.com/docs/text-patterns/titles)

### "For example" at the end of the sentence

The Portuguese often includes the phrases por exemplo at the end of a sentence. This is not grammatically incorrect in English. However, it is infrquently used in this position as it’s meant as an introduction. For example can follow nouns or noun phrases, verbs, or dependent clauses, and, therefore, be in the middle of a sentence.

Reference: [‘For example’: Inside a Sentence](https://open.library.okstate.edu/internationalcomposition/chapter/for-example-inside-a-sentence/)[](https://open.library.okstate.edu/internationalcomposition/chapter/for-example-inside-a-sentence/)

When translating, for example can be placed at the beginning or in the middle of the sentence, and sometimes even omitted. Also, such as is a good option to introduce examples at the end of a sentence.

Examples:

1.  O compartilhamento de filtros facilita a análise do seu time de pedidos dentro de um mesmo contexto, e permite que atendentes de suporte revisem o mesmo conjunto de pedidos, por exemplo.

*   Sharing filters makes it easier for your order team to analyze orders within the same context and allows support staff to review the same set of requests.

3.  Até então, a página só permitia selecionar períodos fixos como "Semana passada", por exemplo.

*   Before, the page only allowed retailers to select fixed periods, such as "Last week".

5.  É comum que isso ocorra quando a loja utiliza \`specificationIDs\` como filtros, por exemplo.

*   For instance, this issue usually occurs when the store uses \`specificationIDs\` as filters.

### It is necessary / É necessário

The Portuguese source often starts sentences with É necessário in documentation. It is necessary is a literal translation and it’s awkward in English. This can often be translated as You need to or You must.

Examples:

1.  É necessário também desinstalar do workspace Master \*\*todas\*\* as apps que dependem de \`vtex.store\`.

*   You must also uninstall \*\*all\*\* apps that depend on \`vtex.store\` from the Master workspace.

3.  Existem cenários em que é necessário mudar o nível hierárquico de uma categoria.

*   There are cases where you need to change the hierarchy level of a category.

### Plural of status

The plural of status can simply be status (with no change) or statuses (with an “es”). Use statuses as the plural of status.

Example:

Possible statuses include: "open" and "blocked".

External examples: [Google](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/set-your-status-97a67224-3bff-41a2-9eb8-c7af966548d8)

### Step-by-step

In English, step-by-step is an adjective phrase and requires a noun to convey a complete thought. Never use on its own. Often passo a passo can be translated simply as instructions or guide, especially if it’s the title of a section.

Examples:

1.  Confira o passo a passo para ativar o seller em Conectar seller.

*   Follow the instructions to activate the seller in Connecting sellers.

3.  Siga o passo a passo abaixo para realizar o preenchimento destes campos:

*   Follow the steps below to complete these fields:

5.  Preparamos um passo-a-passo completo para que você possa rapidamente configurar e começar a usar na sua loja:

*   We have prepared a complete step-by-step guide so you can quickly set it up and start using it in your store:

### Responsible for

Responsável is a very common phrase in Portuguese to explain the purpose of an element. In most cases, however, responsible for is superfluos in English. Most of the time you can omit this phrase and use the verb directly.

Examples:

✔️ The second row of the `flex-layout` block renders the main information about the product.

✘ The second row of the `flex-layout` block is responsible for rendering the main information about the product.

✔️ Lastly, the `matchType` prop is determines the necessary number of valid conditions for the layout rendering.

✘ Lastly, the `matchType` prop is responsible for deciding the necessary number of valid conditions for the layout rendering.

✔️ Optional block that renders chevron or other UI elements that change when the disclosure is opened or closed.

✘ Optional block responsible for rendering chevron or other UI elements that change when the disclosure is opened or closed.

### Inform

Inform is a false cognate of Informar in Portuguese. The term Inform means to formally disclose information or give an essential principle. You can use enter to mean completing a field, or indicate when something signals certain information in the UI.

Examples:

✔️ Boolean. Default: true. Informs whether a separate item should be created in case the items to be updated have attachments.

✘ Boolean. Default: true. Indicates that a separate item should be created if the items to be updated have attachments.

✔️ Using this tag indicates duplicate content to search engines and prioritizes it correctly in page tracking.

✘ Using this tag informs search engines about duplicate content and prioritizes them correctly in page tracking.

✔️ Enter the custom parameter Value.

✘ Inform the custom parameter Value.

### Etc.

Avoid using etc., and so forth, and and so on wherever possible. If you really need to use one, use etc. Always include the period, even if a comma follows immediately after.

Examples:

✔️ Your app might experience problems such as instability or high latency.

✔️ Your app might experience problems, including instability or high latency.

✘ Your app might experience instability, high latency, and so on.

✘ Your app might experience instability, high latency, etc.

✘ If your app experiences instability, high latency, etc., follow these steps:

Legal documents
---------------

More than in any other area, legal translations must transfer the exact meaning from the source language to the target language, making sure no content is omitted or misinterpreted. Because this type of translation includes sensitive content and complex language skills, our best practice is to have this task performed by a translator and a reviewer.

To help you in this process, you can use our legal translation memory and glossary in the CAT tool. Besides, below you will find some rules to follow when translating contracts into English.

### Numbers

In a contract or an agreement, key numbers that are essential to the document will generally be spelled out and in numeral form (in this order) to increase certainty. Those numbers will probably be in this format in the source text. However, depending on the source language, their order might differ from English. For example:

Portuguese: 200 (duzentos) itens

English: two hundred (200) items

Portuguese: 1 (um)

English: one (1)

Portuguese: “a quantia de R$ 10.500 (dez mil e quinhentos reais)”

English: “the amount of ten thousand five hundred reais (BRL 10,500)”

(Note: When writing out large numbers, do not use “and” except for separating the decimals, such as in “one hundred fifty million six hundred ninety-seven thousand three hundred forty-five euro and 45 cents”)

### Telephone and postal codes

Telephone and postal codes must be grouped following the national practice applied in the country of that particular number. Do not apply the national writing practices of one country to phone numbers and postal codes of other countries.

In international contracts, add the international code as a prefix, preceded by a plus (+). For example:

+1 510 642 1799

U.S. number

+55 (11) 98765 4321

Brazilian number

+39 06 696 211

Italian (fixed line) number

### Currency and symbols

In legal documents, use the ISO code when the monetary unit is accompanied by an amount. It must be followed by a hard space and the amount in figures.

To write a hard space, press Ctrl+Shift+Space (for Mac, Option+Space).

Examples:

The amount required is EUR 500

A sum of USD 300 was spent

You can find an exhaustive list of codes [here](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes).

### Numbering system

When the following numbering styles are used in the original text, they should be used in the translation:

*   Roman numerals: I, II, III, IV, etc.
*   Capital letters: A, B, C, D, etc.
*   Arabic numerals: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
*   Lowercase letters: (a), (b), (c), (d), etc.
*   Lowercase Roman numerals: (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), etc.

### Abbreviations

To use a shortened form or abbreviation, please use the full form in its first occurrence.

When translating abbreviations/acronyms, sometimes it will be better to spell everything out to make it easier for the reader in the target language. This happens when the abbreviations mean something specifically from the source language/country that is not well-known in the target language.

A commonly used abbreviation used in the signing section at the end of contracts is “[attn.](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/attn)” and it means “for the attention of”. Please make sure it is abbreviated correctly.

### Company information

Below you can find the company information, such as address and CNPJ, as they usually appear in our contracts and agreements. You can see that the city and state are translated, as well as the spelled out form of CNPJ, while the address was kept as in the source language.

Portuguese (source): VTEX BRASIL TECNOLOGIA PARA E-COMMERCE LTDA, com sede na Avenida Brigadeiro Faria Lima n.º 4.440, 10º andar, bairro Vila Olímpia, na cidade de São Paulo, estado de São Paulo, inscrita no Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jurídica do Ministério da Fazenda (CNPJ/MF) sob o n.º 05.314.972/0001-74 \[...\]

English (target): VTEX BRASIL TECNOLOGIA PARA E-COMMERCE LTDA, headquartered at Avenida Brigadeiro Faria Lima, n.º 4.440, 10º andar, Vila Olímpia, in the city of São Paulo, state of São Paulo, registered with the Brazilian National Registry of Legal Entities (CNPJ/MF) under No. 05.314.972/0001-74 \[...\]

### Pronominal adverbs

Pronominal adverbs are commonly used in legal texts and sometimes in standard English, such as ✔️ whereby, thereby, thereafter, thereof, thereto, herein, herewith, and hereinafter. Others, such as ✘ heretofore, hereunder, and wherefore, have become archaic or overly formal and should be avoided. Try to replace them as follows:

Instead of…

Use

heretofore

previously or until now

hereunder

below or under the terms of this document

wherefore

for which, on account of which, and therefore, for which purpose or why

This type of adverb should preferably be used only where they specifically refer to “the present text”, as for example in “hereto attached” or “herein described”.
